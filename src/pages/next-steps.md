As we continue to enhance our platform, we're excited to share the upcoming features and improvements. {% .lead %}  

## Refill Offer

Advertisers will have an option to [refill](/offer#lifecycle) the offer instead of canceling it.

## Cancel Offer

Advertisers will have an option to [cancel](/cancel-offer) the offer on **destination chain** and **in batches**.

## Protocol Fee

The [protocol fee](/protocol-fee) will reduce **to 0%** by participating in **governance** and **ecosystem growth**.

## Offer Parameters

An additional `extra` field of arbitrary bytes will be added to the [offer parameters](/offer#parameters) to store extra chain-specific info, such as Solana token program.

## Private Offers

Advertisers will have an option to **restrict who can accept** the offer.

## ZK Offers

We aim to support **zero-knowledge offer execution**, ensuring that no one knows who created or accepted the offer, and for which amount.

## Multi Token Offers

Advertisers will have an option to sell source tokens **for multiple destination tokens** at the same time instead of creating different offers and dividing liquidity for each one.
