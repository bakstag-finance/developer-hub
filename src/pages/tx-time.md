1. First, you wait for the transaction to succeed on the **source chain**.
2. Then, you wait for LayerZero to confirm and deliver it to the **destination chain**.

This process is still significantly **faster than bridging**. We've seen transactions complete in **under 2 minutes**, though actual times may vary depending on network load, [LayerZero load](https://layerzeroscan.com), and other factors.
